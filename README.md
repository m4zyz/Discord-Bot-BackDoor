# Discord-Bot-BackDoor

This Discord.js bot is in a way a backdoor of administrator. 
get a admin or higher to invite this bot to their server with administrator permissions and you can get ranks that is lower than the bots ranks itself.

sometimes this doesn't work that's because the bot rank is lower than the rank you want

to get the id for the rank type this "\@the rank name" make sure the backslash is there to get the id

i dont want to write down how to get this bot up and running so if you dont know how to set a discord.js bot up i suggest go find a youtube tutorial about it.

i do not condone hacking illegaly and what i mean by that is don't get someone you don't know in person or are friends with to invite this kind of bot to a server
this bot was made in a way to get a rank when you type a command in but there was a way to get admin ranks with it and then i made it to be that. And i made this bot for fun.
Don't destroy discord servers without permission!
